# How powerful are gnns

## Basic Ideas summarized
1. GNNS are at Most as powerful as the WL (Weisfeiler -Lehman) test in distinguishing graph structures
2. Conditions on the neighbor aggregation and graph readout functions under which the reuslting GNN is as powerful as the WL test
3. Indentify graph structures that cannot be distinguished by popular GNN variants, GCNs and GraphSAGE

4. GINs are developed (Graph Isomorphism Network) which is equal to the power of the WL test


Graph sage is 
Max(Relu(W * h_u (k-1)), for all u \in N(v))

GCN is the mean of all neighbors of a node + itself times the weights and then relued all 

WL test, each iteration, two different types of connections get different colors, keep on going until you can't change colors

Why do the say this is from a countable universe?Why do they need to clarify that?


Suggested that maximally effect GNN is injective as all unique inputs must be mapped to a unique output
Injective meaning one to one (due 109 !!!!!!)


Thus, a maximally effective GNN must map graphs that are isomorphic to the same encoding and 


In Lemma 2, it says that
